# Rent-Increment-Project
Excel VBA Project to optimize the daily administrative work.<br>
In this project i have written some useful VBA Codes to optimize my daily administrative work in letting agency.
<br>
over here I am increasing my tenats rent. To keep an record whether the tenant has started paying his new rent from the corrosponding month.
The entire row changes into different color when I click on check boxes. <br>
It helps and saves my lot of time at the end of month while reporting my manager.
